This is a single-page Web application that allows players to take Pub Quiz to earn points("money").

This application allows a player to join a game, track the playerâ€™s earnings, and finish appropriately when a player answers three questions incorrectly or chooses to stop. Then the game should restart.

The questions will be obtained from the online trivia collection at https://opentdb.com/api_config.php.
